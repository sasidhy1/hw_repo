###Three observable trends:
1. Both *Capomulin* and *Ramicane* prove to be passing and effective drug treatments, with (1) substantial decreases in tumor volume, (2) slowed growth of metastatic sites, and (3) higher subject survival rates.
2. Ketapril seems to have the most deleterious effect on the test subjects, with (1) greatest increase in tumor volume, (2) a rapid drop in survival rate resembling creep, and (3) a substantial jump in metastatic sites, even surpassing the placebo on day 45.
3. The placebo worked as expected, with (1) the quickest growth rate of metastatic sites (without drug intervention), (2) regular progression of tumor volume, and (3) generally no effect on survival rate, with the trend between the extremes of effective and harmful treatments.
