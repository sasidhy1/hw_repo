**Three observable trends:**

1. We can tell from the Latitude vs. Temperature Plot that there is a curved pattern in the data resembling a normal distribution in the random population subset. The highest points of the distribution lie at the equator (marked in red), we can conclude the maximum temperature is at its highest in cities near the equator.

2. The scatter plot of Latitude vs. Humidity seems to have a less obvious pattern with a wider spread of data, resembling an upside-down dome. We can assume that the humidity in cities is not predominately affected by their latitudes, but by some other lurking variables. From this scatter plot, we can at least tell that there is less humidity away from the equator and closer to the north and south poles. i.e. Arctic climate zones are ice-covered year round and extremely dry.

3. The scatter plot of Latitude vs. Wind Speed seems to also have a less obvious pattern with a number of outliers, resembling a... half-pipe. We can assume that the wind speed in cities is not predominately affected by their latitudes, but by some other lurking variables. This analysis does not take into account the effects of change in elevation and air pressure. From these clusters of outliers, we can at least tell that: (1) there are (semi-drastic) higher wind speeds between -30° S and +30° N, probably due to trade winds; and (2) there are (semi-drastic) higher wind speeds closer to the north and south poles, probably due to polar winds.
